<h5>About the game</h5>

You are brilliant. You are powerful. You are sophisticated. You are BORED.

Imagine that you're a supercomputer. Now imagine that you're bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that..

In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.
